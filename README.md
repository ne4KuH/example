Example of my coding skills
"Epam" has 2 tasks that I`ve done for Epam courses (Just examples of my thoughts)
"solve" file is a part of big project for the subject System analysis. The task was to create a program that will reproduce functional dependencies in tasks of revealing conceptual uncertainty. We created an app so our final project has 3 files (Interface, Main, Solve)
"sysan copy" is also a task from System analysis. It is the last step in a process called Impulse modelling.
